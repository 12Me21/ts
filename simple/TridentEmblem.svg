	this one is so badly corrupted (and it's always been like this) that there's not much i can do without just recreating the shape.
	from what i can tell, the geometric parts of it are basically:
	<!--
	<path d="M 0,20 c 0,4 8,13 18,13 s 18,-9 18,-13 h-36 Z"/>
	
	<g fill="none" stroke="orange">
		<path d="M 18,31 v-20" stroke-width="4"/>
		<path d="M 29,16 l -11,15 l -11,-15" stroke-width="2"/>
	</g>
	<g fill="orange">
		<path d="M 22,32 l -4,4 l -4,-4 l 4,-4 l 4,4 Z"/>
		<path d="M 10.5,7.5 l 7.5,-7.5 l 7.5,7.5 l -7.5,7.5 l -7.5,-7.5 Z"/>
		<path d="M 24.5,14.5 l 4.5,-4.5 l 4.5,4.5 l -4.5,4.5 l -4.5,-4.5 Z"/>
		<path d="M 2.5,14.5 l 4.5,-4.5 l 4.5,4.5 l -4.5,4.5 l -4.5,-4.5 Z"/>
	</g>
	-->
	while the rest is just total garbage.
