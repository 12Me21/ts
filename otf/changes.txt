(I may have forgotten some changes here)
notes:
- i've added darkened/lightened "fringes" around the edge of some layers, to make them visible on light/dark backgrounds (these are rendered by drawing a layer twice: first in black or white, and then in the final color)
- i reverted some changes made by twemoji updates, particularly with heart colors. (idk why they changed those, the originals were more consistent with other fonts)
